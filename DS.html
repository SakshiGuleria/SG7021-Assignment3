                        <p>Behold, the ultimate cult-favorite. There's a reason this dry shampoo has stood the
						test of time: It leaves you feeling totally fresh and clean while adding some texture to
						your roots and strands, which is ideal for styling. Use it on clean hair, too!</p><br>

                        <p>This has to be the most borrowed (ahem, stolen) product from my personal beauty stash.
						It is wildly popular for the way it not only sops up any greasy build-up, but also adds volume.</p><br>

                        <p>As a sucker for fun packaging, I was an instant fan of Amika's dry shampoo.
						Thankfully, it performs just as well as it looks. You can be heavy handed with this
						spray (I definitely am post-workouts), but never need to worry about it looking powdery.</p><br>

                        <p>Like all of Moroccanoil's products, this dry shampoo has the nourishing properties
						of argan oil infused in every spritz so hair doesn't get dry. I'm also a fan because
						it comes in light tones and dark tones, so people with black hair like me can avoid
						getting that dreaded white powder residue.</p><br>

						It is still reliable as ever at absorbing excess oil, and now comes in fun 
						scents like coconut and citrus.</p><br>

                        <p>Summer is the right time to unleash your fantasy and discover the potential
						of lengthy locks. A subtly feathered cut will let your strands flow nicely over
						the shoulders and won’t give many undesired flyaways in an updo or a braid. The 
						fans of edgier looks may go for shags, heavier layers or undercut styles.</p><br>

                        <p>Midi length hair is the golden mean that lets you enjoy free-flowing locks
						or sweep your hair up in a cute updo whenever the mood strikes you. If you want
						to rest from the maintenance of longer locks, consider a trendy shoulder-grazing
						cut and enjoy the benefits that come along. We are ready to suggest numerous varieties
						of bobs, lobs and midi shags.</p><br>
